# Vectorize

- `sum.py` implements simple add kernel with vectorize for targets: cpu, stream and parallel.
- `polynomial.py` implements discriminant kernel with vectorize for targets: cpu, stream and parallel.
- `cuda_polynomial.py` implements discriminant kernel with vectorize for CUDA GPU.

All scriptes are runnable.
