    "## Preface\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend to follow this tutorial by **executing the code cells on your local machine**, along with the tutor. Every sub-topic we will cover in this tutorial will be concluded by a few **exercises with different levels of difficulty** (*easy*, *advanced* and *hard*). We will give you **~10-15 min to solve the exercises** and present a possible solution afterwards. In case we don't have time to show all the solutions or in the likely case that you don't manage to solve all of them: we will provide a **sample solution** for all exercises **after the course**.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The estimated time for this tutorial is ~2 hours. Feel free to **interrupt at any time** to ask questions or **talk to the assisting tutors** when you encounter errors or the code doesn't work as expected.\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The material presented here is partly based on: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Notebooks provided in the [Astropy Tutorials](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-tutorials) repository.\n",
    "- And the [Astropy Introduction for Gammapy Users](https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy-extra/blob/master/notebooks/astropy_introduction.ipynb) notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Astropy package is structured into several submodules and we will cover (what we consider) the most important of them in the following order:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [astropy.units](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/units/index.html) and in particular [astropy.units.Quantities](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/api/astropy.units.Quantity.html) to do astronomical calculations with units.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [astropy.coordinates](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/coordinates/) and in particular the classes [SkyCoord](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/api/astropy.coordinates.SkyCoord.html) and [Angle](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/coordinates/angles.html) to handle astronomical sky positions, coordinate systems and coordinate transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [astropy.io.fits](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/io/fits/index.html) to open and write data files in [FITS format](https://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits_documentation.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "- [astropy.tables](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/table/index.html) and [Table](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/api/astropy.table.Table.html) class to handle astronomical data tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- (optional) Plotting os astronomical sky images with [astropy.visualization.wcsaxes](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/visualization/wcsaxes/)\n",
    "#- (optional) Define regions in the sky with the [region](http://astropy-regions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html) package\n",
    "- (optional) manipulate [Times and Dates](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/time/index.html)\n",
